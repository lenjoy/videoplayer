Hi, this is Cíntia

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.500
and this is the TikTok ad policy platform

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.066
here we

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.533
will talk about the policies applied in Brazil

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.366
and today we

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.333
will talk about policies related to content

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.966
that's inappropriate

8
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.000
or unsuitable

9
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:13.966
here on TikTok

10
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.533
we always want to protect our communities

11
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.933
that's why we require that ads on our platform

12
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.266
do not contain any type of content

13
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.000
that's inappropriate

14
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
such as, for example

15
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500
dangerous acts

16
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.733
harmful and violent

17
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:28.700
also

18
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.333
depreciative and degrading content is not allowed

19
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.566
OR unpleasant content

20
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.800
disrespectful and profane

21
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.466
furthermore

22
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.866
content that refers to any event or theme

23
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.800
these sensitive events

24
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.166
they can be natural disasters

25
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.533
or man-made events

26
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.066
like for example

27
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.166
attacks on an individual or a community

28
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.666
protests

29
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.600
and this was a summary

30
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.266
of our policies on inappropriate or

31
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.933
unsuitable content

32
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.800
